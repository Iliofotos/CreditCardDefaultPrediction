# Credit Card Default Prediction

Machine learning project comparing 5 classifiers to predict credit card payment defaults.

## Dataset
- 30,000 credit card clients from Taiwan
- 23 features (demographics, payment history, bill amounts)
- Binary classification: will client default next month?

## Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Key Findings
- Random Forest achieved best ROC-AUC (0.76)
- Feature scaling significantly improved KNN and Naive Bayes performance
- GaussianNB reached 70% balanced accuracy after scaling

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Course
MSc Artificial Intelligence - European University Cyprus
